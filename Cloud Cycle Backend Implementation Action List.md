***

## **Order of Implementation (Recommended)**

**Start with:** Actions 1-7 (Basic setup and core functionality)
**Then:** Actions 8-11 (Real-time features and statistics)
**Next:** Actions 12-15 (Admin features and communication)
**Finally:** Actions 16-25 (Security, advanced features, and optimization)

Each action will involve specific database queries, API endpoints, and integration steps that I can explain in detail when you're ready to implement them one by one.

**Which action would you like me to explain first with detailed implementation steps?**
